The concept of streams in computing usually describes the delivery of data in a steady, continuous flow. You can use streams for reading from or writing to a source continuously, thus eliminating the need to fit all the data in memory at once.

Using streams provides two major advantages. One is that you can use your memory efficiently since you do not have to load all the data into memory before you can begin processing. Another advantage is that using streams is time-efficient. You can start processing data almost immediately instead of waiting for the entire payload. These advantages make streams a suitable tool for large data transfer in I/O operations. Files are a collection of bytes that contain some data. Since files are a common data source in Node.js, streams can provide an efficient way to work with files in Node.js.

Node.js provides a streaming API in the stream module, a core Node.js module, for working with streams. All Node.js streams are an instance of the EventEmitter class (for more on this, see Using Event Emitters in Node.js). They emit different events you can listen for at various intervals during the data transmission process. The native stream module provides an interface consisting of different functions for listening to those events that you can use to read and write data, manage the transmission life cycle, and handle transmission errors.

There are four different kinds of streams in Node.js. They are:

Readable streams: streams you can read data from.
Writable streams: streams you can write data to.
Duplex streams: streams you can read from and write to (usually simultaneously).
Transform streams: a duplex stream in which the output (or writable stream) is dependent on the modification of the input (or readable stream).
The file system module (fs) is a native Node.js module for manipulating files and navigating the local file system in general. It provides several methods for doing this. Two of these methods implement the streaming API. They provide an interface for reading and writing files using streams. Using these two methods, you can create readable and writable file streams.

In this article, you will read from and write to a file using the fs.createReadStream and fs.createWriteStream functions. You will also use the output of one stream as the input of another and implement a custom transform steam. By performing these actions, you will learn to use streams to work with files in Node.js. To demonstrate these concepts, you will write a command-line program with commands that replicate the cat functionality found in Linux-based systems, write input from a terminal to a file, copy files, and transform the content of a file.

Step 1 — Setting up a File Handling Command-Line Program
In this step, you will write a command-line program with basic commands. This command-line program will demonstrate the concepts you’ll learn later in the tutorial, where you’ll use these commands with the functions you’ll create to work with files.

To begin, create a folder to contain all your files for this program. In your terminal, create a folder named node-file-streams:
The concept of streams in computing usually describes the delivery of data in a steady, continuous flow. You can use streams for reading from or writing to a source continuously, thus eliminating the need to fit all the data in memory at once.

Using streams provides two major advantages. One is that you can use your memory efficiently since you do not have to load all the data into memory before you can begin processing. Another advantage is that using streams is time-efficient. You can start processing data almost immediately instead of waiting for the entire payload. These advantages make streams a suitable tool for large data transfer in I/O operations. Files are a collection of bytes that contain some data. Since files are a common data source in Node.js, streams can provide an efficient way to work with files in Node.js.

Node.js provides a streaming API in the stream module, a core Node.js module, for working with streams. All Node.js streams are an instance of the EventEmitter class (for more on this, see Using Event Emitters in Node.js). They emit different events you can listen for at various intervals during the data transmission process. The native stream module provides an interface consisting of different functions for listening to those events that you can use to read and write data, manage the transmission life cycle, and handle transmission errors.

There are four different kinds of streams in Node.js. They are:

Readable streams: streams you can read data from.
Writable streams: streams you can write data to.
Duplex streams: streams you can read from and write to (usually simultaneously).
Transform streams: a duplex stream in which the output (or writable stream) is dependent on the modification of the input (or readable stream).
The file system module (fs) is a native Node.js module for manipulating files and navigating the local file system in general. It provides several methods for doing this. Two of these methods implement the streaming API. They provide an interface for reading and writing files using streams. Using these two methods, you can create readable and writable file streams.

In this article, you will read from and write to a file using the fs.createReadStream and fs.createWriteStream functions. You will also use the output of one stream as the input of another and implement a custom transform steam. By performing these actions, you will learn to use streams to work with files in Node.js. To demonstrate these concepts, you will write a command-line program with commands that replicate the cat functionality found in Linux-based systems, write input from a terminal to a file, copy files, and transform the content of a file.

To complete this tutorial, you will need:

Node.js installed on your development machine. This tutorial uses version 14.10.0. For installation on various platforms, see our tutorial series How to Install Node.js and Create a Local Development Environment.
Basic knowledge of Node.js, which you can find in our series How to Code in Node.js.
Basic knowledge of the Node.js fs module, which you can find in How To Work with Files using the fs Module in Node.js.

Step 1 — Setting up a File Handling Command-Line Program
In this step, you will write a command-line program with basic commands. This command-line program will demonstrate the concepts you’ll learn later in the tutorial, where you’ll use these commands with the functions you’ll create to work with files.

To begin, create a folder to contain all your files for this program. In your terminal, create a folder named node-file-streams:
The concept of streams in computing usually describes the delivery of data in a steady, continuous flow. You can use streams for reading from or writing to a source continuously, thus eliminating the need to fit all the data in memory at once.

Using streams provides two major advantages. One is that you can use your memory efficiently since you do not have to load all the data into memory before you can begin processing. Another advantage is that using streams is time-efficient. You can start processing data almost immediately instead of waiting for the entire payload. These advantages make streams a suitable tool for large data transfer in I/O operations. Files are a collection of bytes that contain some data. Since files are a common data source in Node.js, streams can provide an efficient way to work with files in Node.js.

Node.js provides a streaming API in the stream module, a core Node.js module, for working with streams. All Node.js streams are an instance of the EventEmitter class (for more on this, see Using Event Emitters in Node.js). They emit different events you can listen for at various intervals during the data transmission process. The native stream module provides an interface consisting of different functions for listening to those events that you can use to read and write data, manage the transmission life cycle, and handle transmission errors.

There are four different kinds of streams in Node.js. They are:

Readable streams: streams you can read data from.
Writable streams: streams you can write data to.
Duplex streams: streams you can read from and write to (usually simultaneously).
Transform streams: a duplex stream in which the output (or writable stream) is dependent on the modification of the input (or readable stream).
The file system module (fs) is a native Node.js module for manipulating files and navigating the local file system in general. It provides several methods for doing this. Two of these methods implement the streaming API. They provide an interface for reading and writing files using streams. Using these two methods, you can create readable and writable file streams.

In this article, you will read from and write to a file using the fs.createReadStream and fs.createWriteStream functions. You will also use the output of one stream as the input of another and implement a custom transform steam. By performing these actions, you will learn to use streams to work with files in Node.js. To demonstrate these concepts, you will write a command-line program with commands that replicate the cat functionality found in Linux-based systems, write input from a terminal to a file, copy files, and transform the content of a file.

Two of these methods implement the streaming API. They provide an interface for reading and writing files using streams. Using these two methods, you can create readable and writable file streams.

In this article, you will read from and write to a file using the fs.createReadStream and fs.createWriteStream functions. You will also use the output of one stream as the input of another and implement a custom transform steam. By performing these actions, you will learn to use streams to work with files in Node.js. To demonstrate these concepts, you will write a command-line program with commands that replicate the cat functionality found in Linux-based systems, write input from a terminal to a file, copy files, and transform the content of a file.

The concept of streams in computing usually describes the delivery of data in a steady, continuous flow. You can use streams for reading from or writing to a source continuously, thus eliminating the need to fit all the data in memory at once.

Using streams provides two major advantages. One is that you can use your memory efficiently since you do not have to load all the data into memory before you can begin processing. Another advantage is that using streams is time-efficient. You can start processing data almost immediately instead of waiting for the entire payload. These advantages make streams a suitable tool for large data transfer in I/O operations. Files are a collection of bytes that contain some data. Since files are a common data source in Node.js, streams can provide an efficient way to work with files in Node.js.

Node.js provides a streaming API in the stream module, a core Node.js module, for working with streams. All Node.js streams are an instance of the EventEmitter class (for more on this, see Using Event Emitters in Node.js). They emit different events you can listen for at various intervals during the data transmission process. The native stream module provides an interface consisting of different functions for listening to those events that you can use to read and write data, manage the transmission life cycle, and handle transmission errors.

There are four different kinds of streams in Node.js. They are:

Readable streams: streams you can read data from.
Writable streams: streams you can write data to.
Duplex streams: streams you can read from and write to (usually simultaneously).
Transform streams: a duplex stream in which the output (or writable stream) is dependent on the modification of the input (or readable stream).

They emit different events you can listen for at various intervals during the data transmission process. The native stream module provides an interface consisting of different functions for listening to those events that you can use to read and write data, manage the transmission life cycle, and handle transmission errors.

There are four different kinds of streams in Node.js. They are:

Readable streams: streams you can read data from.
Writable streams: streams you can write data to.
Duplex streams: streams you can read from and write to (usually simultaneously).
Transform streams: a duplex stream in which the output (or writable stream) is dependent on the modification of the input (or readable stream).
The file system module (fs) is a native Node.js module for manipulating files and navigating the local file system in general. It provides several methods for doing this. Two of these methods implement the streaming API. They provide an interface for reading and writing files using streams. Using these two methods, you can create readable and writable file streams.

In this article, you will read from and write to a file using the fs.createReadStream and fs.createWriteStream functions. You will also use the output of one stream as the input of another and implement a custom transform steam. By performing these actions, you will learn to use streams to work with files in Node.js. To demonstrate these concepts, you will write a command-line program with commands that replicate the cat functionality found in Linux-based systems, write input from a terminal to a file, copy files, and transform the content of a file.

Step 1 — Setting up a File Handling Command-Line Program
In this step, you will write a command-line program with basic commands. This command-line program will demonstrate the concepts you’ll learn later in the tutorial, where you’ll use these commands with the functions you’ll create to work with files.

To begin, create a folder to contain all your files for this program. In your terminal, create a folder named node-file-streams:
The concept of streams in computing usually describes the delivery of data in a steady, continuous flow. You can use streams for reading from or writing to a source continuously, thus eliminating the need to fit all the data in memory at once.

Using streams provides two major advantages. One is that you can use your memory efficiently since you do not have to load all the data into memory before you can begin processing. Another advantage is that using streams is time-efficient. You can start processing data almost immediately instead of waiting for the entire payload. These advantages make streams a suitable tool for large data transfer in I/O operations. Files are a collection of bytes that contain some data. Since files are a common data source in Node.js, streams can provide an efficient way to work with files in Node.js.

Using streams provides two major advantages. One is that you can use your memory efficiently since you do not have to load all the data into memory before you can begin processing. Another advantage is that using streams is time-efficient. You can start processing data almost immediately instead of waiting for the entire payload. These advantages make streams a suitable tool for large data transfer in I/O operations. Files are a collection of bytes that contain some data. Since files are a common data source in Node.js, streams can provide an efficient way to work with files in Node.js.

Node.js provides a streaming API in the stream module, a core Node.js module, for working with streams. All Node.js streams are an instance of the EventEmitter class (for more on this, see Using Event Emitters in Node.js). They emit different events you can listen for at various intervals during the data transmission process. The native stream module provides an interface consisting of different functions for listening to those events that you can use to read and write data, manage the transmission life cycle, and handle transmission errors.

There are four different kinds of streams in Node.js. They are:

Readable streams: streams you can read data from.
Writable streams: streams you can write data to.
Duplex streams: streams you can read from and write to (usually simultaneously).
Transform streams: a duplex stream in which the output (or writable stream) is dependent on the modification of the input (or readable stream).
The file system module (fs) is a native Node.js module for manipulating files and navigating the local file system in general. It provides several methods for doing this. Two of these methods implement the streaming API. They provide an interface for reading and writing files using streams. Using these two methods, you can create readable and writable file streams.

In this article, you will read from and write to a file using the fs.createReadStream and fs.createWriteStream functions. You will also use the output of one stream as the input of another and implement a custom transform steam. By performing these actions, you will learn to use streams to work with files in Node.js. To demonstrate these concepts, you will write a command-line program with commands that replicate the cat functionality found in Linux-based systems, write input from a terminal to a file, copy files, and transform the content of a file.

Step 1 — Setting up a File Handling Command-Line Program
In this step, you will write a command-line program with basic commands. This command-line program will demonstrate the concepts you’ll learn later in the tutorial, where you’ll use these commands with the functions you’ll create to work with files.

To begin, create a folder to contain all your files for this program. In your terminal, create a folder named node-file-streams:

The concept of streams in computing usually describes the delivery of data in a steady, continuous flow. You can use streams for reading from or writing to a source continuously, thus eliminating the need to fit all the data in memory at once.

Using streams provides two major advantages. One is that you can use your memory efficiently since you do not have to load all the data into memory before you can begin processing. Another advantage is that using streams is time-efficient. You can start processing data almost immediately instead of waiting for the entire payload. These advantages make streams a suitable tool for large data transfer in I/O operations. Files are a collection of bytes that contain some data. Since files are a common data source in Node.js, streams can provide an efficient way to work with files in Node.js.

Node.js provides a streaming API in the stream module, a core Node.js module, for working with streams. All Node.js streams are an instance of the EventEmitter class (for more on this, see Using Event Emitters in Node.js). They emit different events you can listen for at various intervals during the data transmission process. The native stream module provides an interface consisting of different functions for listening to those events that you can use to read and write data, manage the transmission life cycle, and handle transmission errors.

There are four different kinds of streams in Node.js. They are:

Readable streams: streams you can read data from.
Writable streams: streams you can write data to.
Duplex streams: streams you can read from and write to (usually simultaneously).
Transform streams: a duplex stream in which the output (or writable stream) is dependent on the modification of the input (or readable stream).
The file system module (fs) is a native Node.js module for manipulating files and navigating the local file system in general. It provides several methods for doing this. Two of these methods implement the streaming API. They provide an interface for reading and writing files using streams. Using these two methods, you can create readable and writable file streams.

In this article, you will read from and write to a file using the fs.createReadStream and fs.createWriteStream functions. You will also use the output of one stream as the input of another and implement a custom transform steam. By performing these actions, you will learn to use streams to work with files in Node.js. To demonstrate these concepts, you will write a command-line program with commands that replicate the cat functionality found in Linux-based systems, write input from a terminal to a file, copy files, and transform the content of a file.

To demonstrate these concepts, you will write a command-line program with commands that replicate the cat functionality found in Linux-based systems, write input from a terminal to a file, copy files, and transform the content of a file.

Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you will need:

Node.js installed on your development machine. This tutorial uses version 14.10.0. For installation on various platforms, see our tutorial series How to Install Node.js and Create a Local Development Environment.
Basic knowledge of Node.js, which you can find in our series How to Code in Node.js.
Basic knowledge of the Node.js fs module, which you can find in How To Work with Files using the fs Module in Node.js.

Step 1 — Setting up a File Handling Command-Line Program
In this step, you will write a command-line program with basic commands. This command-line program will demonstrate the concepts you’ll learn later in the tutorial, where you’ll use these commands with the functions you’ll create to work with files.

To begin, create a folder to contain all your files for this program. In your terminal, create a folder named node-file-streams:

The concept of streams in computing usually describes the delivery of data in a steady, continuous flow. You can use streams for reading from or writing to a source continuously, thus eliminating the need to fit all the data in memory at once.

Using streams provides two major advantages. One is that you can use your memory efficiently since you do not have to load all the data into memory before you can begin processing. Another advantage is that using streams is time-efficient. You can start processing data almost immediately instead of waiting for the entire payload. These advantages make streams a suitable tool for large data transfer in I/O operations. Files are a collection of bytes that contain some data. Since files are a common data source in Node.js, streams can provide an efficient way to work with files in Node.js.

Node.js provides a streaming API in the stream module, a core Node.js module, for working with streams. All Node.js streams are an instance of the EventEmitter class (for more on this, see Using Event Emitters in Node.js). They emit different events you can listen for at various intervals during the data transmission process. The native stream module provides an interface consisting of different functions for listening to those events that you can use to read and write data, manage the transmission life cycle, and handle transmission errors.

There are four different kinds of streams in Node.js. They are:

Readable streams: streams you can read data from.
Writable streams: streams you can write data to.
Duplex streams: streams you can read from and write to (usually simultaneously).
Transform streams: a duplex stream in which the output (or writable stream) is dependent on the modification of the input (or readable stream).
The file system module (fs) is a native Node.js module for manipulating files and navigating the local file system in general. It provides several methods for doing this. Two of these methods implement the streaming API. They provide an interface for reading and writing files using streams. Using these two methods, you can create readable and writable file streams.

In this article, you will read from and write to a file using the fs.createReadStream and fs.createWriteStream functions. You will also use the output of one stream as the input of another and implement a custom transform steam. By performing these actions, you will learn to use streams to work with files in Node.js.

Transform streams: a duplex stream in which the output (or writable stream) is dependent on the modification of the input (or readable stream).
The file system module (fs) is a native Node.js module for manipulating files and navigating the local file system in general. It provides several methods for doing this. Two of these methods implement the streaming API. They provide an interface for reading and writing files using streams. Using these two methods, you can create readable and writable file streams.

In this article, you will read from and write to a file using the fs.createReadStream and fs.createWriteStream functions. You will also use the output of one stream as the input of another and implement a custom transform steam. By performing these actions, you will learn to use streams to work with files in Node.js. To demonstrate these concepts, you will write a command-line program with commands that replicate the cat functionality found in Linux-based systems, write input from a terminal to a file, copy files, and transform the content of a file.

Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you will need:

Node.js installed on your development machine. This tutorial uses version 14.10.0. For installation on various platforms, see our tutorial series How to Install Node.js and Create a Local Development Environment.
Basic knowledge of Node.js, which you can find in our series How to Code in Node.js.
Basic knowledge of the Node.js fs module, which you can find in How To Work with Files using the fs Module in Node.js.

Step 1 — Setting up a File Handling Command-Line Program
In this step, you will write a command-line program with basic commands. This command-line program will demonstrate the concepts you’ll learn later in the tutorial, where you’ll use these commands with the functions you’ll create to work with files.

To begin, create a folder to contain all your files for this program. In your terminal, create a folder named node-file-streams:

The concept of streams in computing usually describes the delivery of data in a steady, continuous flow. You can use streams for reading from or writing to a source continuously, thus eliminating the need to fit all the data in memory at once.

Using streams provides two major advantages. One is that you can use your memory efficiently since you do not have to load all the data into memory before you can begin processing. Another advantage is that using streams is time-efficient. You can start processing data almost immediately instead of waiting for the entire payload. These advantages make streams a suitable tool for large data transfer in I/O operations. Files are a collection of bytes that contain some data. Since files are a common data source in Node.js, streams can provide an efficient way to work with files in Node.js.

Node.js provides a streaming API in the stream module, a core Node.js module, for working with streams. All Node.js streams are an instance of the EventEmitter class (for more on this, see Using Event Emitters in Node.js). They emit different events you can listen for at various intervals during the data transmission process. The native stream module provides an interface consisting of different functions for listening to those events that you can use to read and write data, manage the transmission life cycle, and handle transmission errors.

There are four different kinds of streams in Node.js. They are:

Readable streams: streams you can read data from.
Writable streams: streams you can write data to.
Duplex streams: streams you can read from and write to (usually simultaneously).
Transform streams: a duplex stream in which the output (or writable stream) is dependent on the modification of the input (or readable stream).

All Node.js streams are an instance of the EventEmitter class (for more on this, see Using Event Emitters in Node.js). They emit different events you can listen for at various intervals during the data transmission process. The native stream module provides an interface consisting of different functions for listening to those events that you can use to read and write data, manage the transmission life cycle, and handle transmission errors.

There are four different kinds of streams in Node.js. They are:

Readable streams: streams you can read data from.
Writable streams: streams you can write data to.
Duplex streams: streams you can read from and write to (usually simultaneously).
Transform streams: a duplex stream in which the output (or writable stream) is dependent on the modification of the input (or readable stream).
The file system module (fs) is a native Node.js module for manipulating files and navigating the local file system in general. It provides several methods for doing this. Two of these methods implement the streaming API. They provide an interface for reading and writing files using streams. Using these two methods, you can create readable and writable file streams.

In this article, you will read from and write to a file using the fs.createReadStream and fs.createWriteStream functions. You will also use the output of one stream as the input of another and implement a custom transform steam. By performing these actions, you will learn to use streams to work with files in Node.js. To demonstrate these concepts, you will write a command-line program with commands that replicate the cat functionality found in Linux-based systems, write input from a terminal to a file, copy files, and transform the content of a file.

Step 1 — Setting up a File Handling Command-Line Program
In this step, you will write a command-line program with basic commands. This command-line program will demonstrate the concepts you’ll learn later in the tutorial, where you’ll use these commands with the functions you’ll create to work with files.

To begin, create a folder to contain all your files for this program. In your terminal, create a folder named node-file-streams:

The concept of streams in computing usually describes the delivery of data in a steady, continuous flow. You can use streams for reading from or writing to a source continuously, thus eliminating the need to fit all the data in memory at once.

Using streams provides two major advantages. One is that you can use your memory efficiently since you do not have to load all the data into memory before you can begin processing. Another advantage is that using streams is time-efficient. You can start processing data almost immediately instead of waiting for the entire payload. These advantages make streams a suitable tool for large data transfer in I/O operations. Files are a collection of bytes that contain some data.

The concept of streams in computing usually describes the delivery of data in a steady, continuous flow. You can use streams for reading from or writing to a source continuously, thus eliminating the need to fit all the data in memory at once.

Using streams provides two major advantages. One is that you can use your memory efficiently since you do not have to load all the data into memory before you can begin processing. Another advantage is that using streams is time-efficient. You can start processing data almost immediately instead of waiting for the entire payload. These advantages make streams a suitable tool for large data transfer in I/O operations. Files are a collection of bytes that contain some data. Since files are a common data source in Node.js, streams can provide an efficient way to work with files in Node.js.

Node.js provides a streaming API in the stream module, a core Node.js module, for working with streams. All Node.js streams are an instance of the EventEmitter class (for more on this, see Using Event Emitters in Node.js). They emit different events you can listen for at various intervals during the data transmission process. The native stream module provides an interface consisting of different functions for listening to those events that you can use to read and write data, manage the transmission life cycle, and handle transmission errors.

There are four different kinds of streams in Node.js. They are:

Readable streams: streams you can read data from.
Writable streams: streams you can write data to.
Duplex streams: streams you can read from and write to (usually simultaneously).
Transform streams: a duplex stream in which the output (or writable stream) is dependent on the modification of the input (or readable stream).
The file system module (fs) is a native Node.js module for manipulating files and navigating the local file system in general. It provides several methods for doing this. Two of these methods implement the streaming API. They provide an interface for reading and writing files using streams. Using these two methods, you can create readable and writable file streams.

In this article, you will read from and write to a file using the fs.createReadStream and fs.createWriteStream functions. You will also use the output of one stream as the input of another and implement a custom transform steam. By performing these actions, you will learn to use streams to work with files in Node.js. To demonstrate these concepts, you will write a command-line program with commands that replicate the cat functionality found in Linux-based systems, write input from a terminal to a file, copy files, and transform the content of a file.
